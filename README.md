# iberville
Experimenting with procedurally generating a city map

### Usage 
I developed this on node `v0.12.7`.

### Demo
Run `npm start` and copy the output of into http://geojson.io/ to see what was rendered.

### Lessons learned
* Log everything
* Make everything a param that can be tweaked. Really interesting algorithms can easily be torpedoed by crappy params.
